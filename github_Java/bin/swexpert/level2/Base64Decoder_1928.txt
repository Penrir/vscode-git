#1 Life itself is a quotation.
#2 Suspicion follows close on mistrust.
#3 To doubt is safer than to be secure.
#4 Only the just man enjoys peace of mind.
#5 A full belly is the mother of all evil.
#6 A gift in season is a double favor to the needy.
#7 Books are ships which pass through the vast seas of time.
#8 Let thy speech be short, comprehending much in few words.
#9 The world is a beautiful book, but of little use to him who cannot read it.
#10 He who spares the rod hates his son, but he who loves him is careful to discipline him.
